<p></p><strong>The most magnificent poem hasn’t been written yet.</strong>
<u>The most</u> beautiful song hasn’t been sung yet.
The most glorious day hasn’t been lived yet.
The most immense sea hasn’t been pioneered yet,
The most prolonged travel hasn’t been done yet.
The immortal dance hasn’t been performed ye,
The most shine star hasn’t been discovered yet.
When we don’t know any more what we are supposed to do,
it’s the time when we can do true something.
When we don’t know any more where we are supposed to go,
it’s the start when the true travel has just begun.
